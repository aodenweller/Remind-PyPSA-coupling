#  REMIND-PyPSA Coupling Tools 

A package to support the coupling of REMIND and PyPSA, written by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Studies' [Energy Transition Lab](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/labs/energy-transition/energy-transition-lab)

## Remind data
Can be exported either as csv or gdx. Both formats can be processed (gdx not yet integrated in the examples)

## Abstracted logic

The package provides an abstracted framework for ETL operations based steps. The steps can be read from YAML into the [transformation class](objects#objects)
